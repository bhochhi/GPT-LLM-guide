Sure, I can include a field to indicate the number of features that are out of standard. A good field name for this could be `nonCompliantFeatureCount`. I will also ensure that the `suggestedValues` are actual recommendations rather than the current values.

Here is the updated JSON template and a full example:

### JSON Template
```json
{
  "url": "string",
  "auditDate": "string",
  "nonCompliantFeatureCount": "integer",
  "features": [
    {
      "featureName": "string",
      "featureCategory": "string",
      "featureStatus": "OK | NOT_OK",
      "currentValue": "string",
      "standardRecommendation": "string",
      "suggestedValues": ["string", "string", "string"],
      "rationale": "string",
      "priority": "High | Medium | Low"
    }
  ]
}
```
